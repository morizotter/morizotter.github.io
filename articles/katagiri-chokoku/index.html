<p>I joined in <a href="http://chokokuseminar.com/">Yuji Katagiri sculpture seminar</a> and created the goblin with clay sculpture.</p>

<h2 id="can-t-make">Can&rsquo;t make</h2>

<p>A clay sculpture using clay is my first experience. I tried to design by myself. And I could not make the one I intended.  I hit mentally against a wall from where a big shape began to appear. There were not enough details in my design. Around eyes, cheeks, mouth and forehead, I could not understand. I faced an ambiguous part in myself. Even though I made shape without understanding, I felt that it was somewhat strange and not natural.</p>

<h2 id="see-the-structure">See the structure</h2>

<p>From 2nd day, I increased the references and looked at them closely. I became able to realise little by little referring to the skeleton and muscle. I got entertaining when I got it. I was devoted to creation. When I felt it was strange, I looked at the muscles, bones and photographs to find out why it was weird. I fond the structure deeper than before.</p>

<h2 id="finally-completed">Finally completed!</h2>

<p>What is necessary to make what I wanted to make. Through my struggle and the appropriate advise by Mr.Katagiri, I was able to make it with feeling that I was progressing on my own.</p>

<p>Through the pain of creation, I was able to face my creation thoroughly in the very free atmosphere.</p>

<p>For three days, I had been facing with creation from morning till evening. I exhausted every day, but I found what a great thing there is.</p>

<h2 id="creation-process">Creation process</h2>

<p>I keep the record of the production process.</p>
