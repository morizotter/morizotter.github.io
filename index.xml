      <description>CITY 3B6FA CITY 3B6FA is my first try to make a full CG animation. It describes a future city.
The end of July, I decided an outlook of the world and in the first 2 weeks of August, I created a storyboard and character design. From the 3rd week of August, I began work on modelling and animation. That time, I always work for a daily job and CG except for sleep time.</description>

      <description>When I held a developer event, I looked for a stopwatch/timer with big numbers. That time, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find out a good one. So , I created.
BNStopwatch was created for iPad. But it is also available in iPhone &amp;amp; AppleWatch.

      <description>I won the Grand Prix in the hackathon held in CROOZ office on Jun 28th.
 テックヒルズ×iBeacon ハッカソン【ハンズオンも同時開催】  The hackathon is to make an iOS application using iBeacon installed in various places in CROOZ office in one day. Finally, I ran around CROOZ and made a 3 and a half minutes demo movie.
It was easy to detect a beacon, but the detection rate is bad. So, I changed the implementation slightly.</description>

      <description>I won the Qiita hackathon held on Nov. 9th. You can see the scene in Qiita Blog. As a prize, I got iPad mini Retina Display model and Amazon gift card 10,000yen.
At that day, the camera of WBS(World Business Satellite), Japanese business news broadcasting service was there, so, I debuted to the tv news. Because it was my first hackathon, I was very nervous and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it succeeds until the end.</description>
